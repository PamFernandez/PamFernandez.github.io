## Data Analyst

Lifelong learner who is enthusiastic about stepping into a Data Analysis position. 

I have a 10+ year background in the Supply Chain where I progressed through a lot of roles – transportation, warehousing, inventory, and importing. 

I hold a Certificate in Data Analysis and Visualization from Northwestern University with over 200 classroom hours of experience managing and visualizing big data sets using tools such as Python and SQL. I have written code for a variety of datasets and can effectively communicate insights from the data. 

My analytical problem solving abilities and keen attention to detail combined with the ability to collaborate with teammates makes me a valuable addition to any team.
